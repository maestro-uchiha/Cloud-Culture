[[deployment.responseHeaders]]
path = "/assets/*"

# --- Optional rewrites (keep commented unless you need SPA behavior) ---
# If you ever convert to an SPA, uncomment below to route all unknown paths to /index.html.

# Note: Custom 404 works automatically—just keep parametric-static/404.html in your Public directory. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
